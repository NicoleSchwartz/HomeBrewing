# HomeBrewing
 Brewing your own beer, even with limited space, is relatively simple.  If you have not yet tried brewing your own and want to see the process, or if you are a beginner who wants to ask some questions on how to upgrade from kits this is for you. We will be walking you through the entire brewing process from initial recipe to bottling.  There will be hand outs with a summary of equipment, process, recipes, as well as ideas on where to buy supplies or find more recipes.
